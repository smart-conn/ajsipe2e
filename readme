gateway_sw contains two VS sub projects:
1. CloudCommEngine
2. IMSTransport

TODOs
1. Currently the IMSTransport depends on Doubango and this dependency will be removed before the release.
2. Will use scons to add the build option on other platforms like Linux.
3. Will modify the connector to be compatible with the gateway agent framework.
